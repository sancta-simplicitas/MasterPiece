All fun, soulful and creative code collection.

## Description

Here's a collection of the fantasy series of code we've been looking up at the sky in school. It's pure, refined and concise, and the beauty of which no one can appreciate.

We believe that high-value code is always based upon careful scrutiny and concrete, convincing proof, not unclear, unwarranted assumptions and anticipations.

Without theory, there would be neither basis nor guidance or any progress and development of mankind. Without imagination, human society would lose precious inspiration, innovation and reformation, and eventually grind to a standstill. Thus, while most professions and academic fields necessitate knowledge, imagination is equally important.
